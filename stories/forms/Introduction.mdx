# Forms

Educata's forms are styled with class names. Be sure to use an appropriate `type` attribute on all inputs.

Each form element has `invalid` style after user submit, to remove this style you can use custom attribute `data-no-validation` on the form element.

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" required data-no-validation />
```
