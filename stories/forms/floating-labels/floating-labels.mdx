# Form labels

Create beautifully simple form labels that float over your input fields.

## Example

Wrap a pair of `<input class="form-control">` and `<label>` elements in `.form-floating` to enable floating labels with Educatas textual form fields.
A placeholder is required on each `<input>` as our method of CSS-only floating labels uses the `:placeholder-shown` pseudo-element.
Also note that the `<input>` must come first so we can utilize a sibling selector (e.g., `~`).

<Canvas of={FormFloatingStories.DefaultExample} className='bg-main' />

When there's a value already defined, `<label>`s will automatically adjust to their floated position.

<Canvas of={FormFloatingStories.DefinedValue} className='bg-main' />

## Textarea

By default, `<textarea`>s with .form-control will be the same height as `<input>`s.

<Canvas of={FormFloatingStories.Textarea} className='bg-main' />

To set a custom height on your `<textarea>`, do not use the rows attribute. Instead, set an explicit height (either inline or via custom CSS).

<Canvas of={FormFloatingStories.TextareaWithValue} className='bg-main' />

## Selects

Other than `.form-control`, floating labels are only available on `.form-selects`.
They work in the same way, but unlike `<input>`s, they'll always show the `<label>` in its floated state.
**Selects with** **`size`** and **`multiple`** are not supported.

<Canvas of={FormFloatingStories.Select} className='bg-main' />

## Disabled

Add the `disabled` boolean attribute on an input, a textarea or a select to give it a grayed out appearance, remove pointer events, and prevent focusing.

<Canvas of={FormFloatingStories.Disabled} className='bg-main' />

## Input groups

Floating labels also support `.input-group`.

<Canvas of={FormFloatingStories.InputGroups} className='bg-main' />

## Layout

When working with the Educata grid system, be sure to place form elements within column classes.

<Canvas of={FormFloatingStories.Layout} className='bg-main' />
