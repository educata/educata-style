# Select

Customize the native `<select>`s with custom CSS that changes the element's initial appearance.

## Default

Custom `<select>` menus need only a custom class, `.form-select` to trigger the custom styles.
Custom styles are limited to the `<select>`'s initial appearance and cannot fully modify the `<option>`s due to browser limitations.

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.FormSelectDefault} className='bg-main' />

## Sizing

You may also choose from small and large custom selects to match our similarly sized text inputs.

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.FormSelectSizing} className='bg-main' />

## Disabled

Add the `disabled` boolean attribute on a select to give it a grayed out appearance and remove pointer events.

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.FormSelectDisabled} className='bg-main' />

## Multiple

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.FormSelectMultiple} className='bg-main' />

## Size

<Canvas of={FormSelectStories.FormSelectSize} className='bg-main' />
