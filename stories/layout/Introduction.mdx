# Layout

Educata is a design system that provides a consistent and cohesive user experience across all platforms and devices.
It is built on the principles of responsive design, accessibility, and usability, ensuring that users can easily navigate and interact with the system regardless of their device or screen size.

Educata design is similar to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), but it is not a direct copy. It is a unique design system that has been tailored to meet the specific needs of Educata users.
Since it's similar to Bootstrap, layout docs are similar to Bootstrap docs.
