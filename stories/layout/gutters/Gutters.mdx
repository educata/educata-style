# Gutters

Gutters are the padding between your columns, used to responsively space and align content in the Educata grid system.

## How they work

- **Gutters are the gaps between column content, created by horizontal `padding`.** We set `padding-right` and `padding-left` on each column, and use negative `margin` to offset that at the start and end of each row to align content.
- **Gutters start at `1.5rem` (`24px`) wide**. This allows us to match our grid to the padding and margin spacers scale.
- **Gutters can be responsively adjusted.** Use breakpoint-specific gutter classes to modify horizontal gutters, vertical gutters, and all gutters.

An alternative solution is to add a wrapper around the `.row` with the `.overflow-hidden` class:

<Canvas of={GuttersStories.OverflowHidden} />

## Vertical gutters

`.gy-*` classes can be used to control the vertical gutter widths within a row when columns wrap to new lines.
Like the horizontal gutters, the vertical gutters can cause some overflow below the `.row` at the end of a page.
If this occurs, you add a wrapper around `.row` with the `.overflow-hidden` class:

<Canvas of={GuttersStories.Vertical} />

## Horizontal & vertical gutters

Use `.g-*` classes to control the horizontal and vertical grid gutters.
In the example below, we use a smaller gutter width, so there isn't a need for the `.overflow-hidden` wrapper class.

## Row columns gutters

Gutter classes can also be added to row columns.
In the following example, we use responsive row columns and responsive gutter classes.

<Canvas of={GuttersStories.RowColumns} />

## No gutters

The gutters between columns in our predefined grid classes can be removed with `.g-0`.
This removes the negative margins from .row and the horizontal padding from all immediate children columns.

Need an edge-to-edge design? Drop the parent `.container` or `.container-fluid` and add `.mx-0` to the `.row` to prevent overflow.

In practice, here's how it looks.
Note that you can continue to use this with all other predefined grid classes (including column widths, responsive tiers, reorders, and more).
