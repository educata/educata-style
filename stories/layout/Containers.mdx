# Containers

Containers are a fundamental building block of Educata that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.

## How they work

Containers are the most basic layout element in Educata and are **required when using our default grid system**.
Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them.
While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

Educata comes with three different containers:

- `.container`, which sets a `max-width` at each responsive breakpoint.
- `.container-{breakpoint}`, which is `width: 100%` until the specified breakpoint.
- `.container-fluid`, which is `width: 100%` at all breakpoints.

The table below illustrates how each container's `max-width` compares to the original `.container` and `.container-fluid` across each breakpoint.

## Default container

Our default `.container` class is a responsive, fixed-width container, meaning its max-width changes at each breakpoint.

```html
<div class="container">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```

## Responsive containers

Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is `100%` wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we apply `max-widths` for each of the higher breakpoints.
For example, `.container-sm` is 100% wide to start until the sm breakpoint is reached, where it will scale up with `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `xxl`.

## Fluid containers

Use `.container-fluid` for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.

```html
<div class="container-fluid">
  ...
</div>
```
