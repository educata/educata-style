# Transition

The transition variables are used to define the transition properties of the project.

```
--ec-transation-duration
--ec-transition-{PROPERTY}
```

`{PROPERTY}` could be one of the following:

- `linear`
- `ease`
- `ease-in`
- `ease-out`
- `ease-in-out`

By defualt `--ec-transation-duration` equals `0.3s` but can be modified.

## Example

<Canvas of={TransitionStories.Example} />

Mostly we use `ease-in-out` or `linear`.
