# Spacing

Educata-Style provides a set of spacing utilities that can be used to add margin and padding to elements.
There are many shorthand utilities for quickly adding margin, padding or gap to an element.

## Margin and Spacing

Apply responsive-friendly `margin` or `padding` to an element or specific sides using shorthand classes.
These classes offer flexibility for individual, global, as well as vertical and horizontal spacing adjustments.
Built using a default Sass map, they provide spacing options from `.25rem` to `3rem`.

> Using the CSS Grid layout module? Consider using the [gap utilities](#gap) for grid gap spacing.

### Usage

Spacing can be used inside any breakpoint.

The class names are based on the following pattern:

```css
.{property}{sides}-{size}
```

Where `{property}` is one of:

- `m` - for classes that set `margin`
- `p` - for classes that set `padding`

Where `{sides}` is one of:

- `t` - for classes that set `margin-top` or `padding-top`
- `b` - for classes that set `margin-bottom` or `padding-bottom`
- `e` - for classes that set both `*-left` and `*-right`
- blank - for classes that set a `margin` or `padding` on all 4 sides of the element
- auto - for classes that set `margin` to `auto`

Where `{size}` is one of:

- `0` - for classes that eliminate the `margin` or `padding` by setting it to `0`
- `1` - for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `.25rem`
- `2` - for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `.5rem`
- `3` - for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `1rem`
- `4` - for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `1.5rem`
- `5` - for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `3rem`

### Examples

```css
.mt-0 {
  margin-top: 0;
}

.p-3 {
  padding: 1rem;
}

.pe-2 {
  padding-left: 0.5rem;
  padding-right: 0.5rem;
}

.m-auto {
  margin: auto;
}
```

### Horizontal centering

You can use the `.m-auto` class to center an element horizontally.

## Gap

When using `display: flex` or `display: grid`, you can use the `gap` utilities to add spacing between elements.
This utility is available for both `row` and `column` directions. Gap utilities are responsive.

<Canvas of={SpacingStories.Gap} />

### row-gap

`row-gap` sets the gap between rows in a container.

<Canvas of={SpacingStories.RowGap} />

### column-gap

`column-gap` sets the gap between columns in a container.

<Canvas of={SpacingStories.ColGap} />
