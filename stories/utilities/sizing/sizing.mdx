# Sizing

Easily make an element as wide or as tall with our width and height utilities.

## Relative to the parent

The width and height utilities are relative to the parent element.
The default values are `25%`, `50%`, `75%`, `100%`, and `auto`.

<Canvas of={SizingStories.Width} />

For height, the same applies. The default values are `25%`, `50%`, `75%`, `100%`, and `auto`.

<Canvas of={SizingStories.Height} />

### Max width and max height

The max width and max height utilities are relative to the parent element.
The default values are `25%`, `50%`, `75%`, `100%`, and `auto`.

Formula uses the same values as width and height, but with `max-` prefix.

```
max-{{w | h}}-{{value}}
```

Where `w` is width and `h` is height.

## Relative to the viewport

Everything is same as above, but the values are relative to the viewport.
The default values are `25vw`, `50vw`, `75vw`, `100vw`, and `auto`.
The formula uses the same values as width and height, but with `vw` or `vh` suffix.

```
{{w | h}}-{{value}}-vw
```

Where `w` is width and `h` is height.

```html
<div class="min-vw-100">Min-width 100vw</div>
<div class="min-vh-100">Min-height 100vh</div>
<div class="vw-100">Width 100vw</div>
<div class="vh-100">Height 100vh</div>
```
