# flex

Quickly manage the layout, alignment, and sizing of grid columns, navigation, components, and more with a full suite of responsive flexbox utilities.
For more complex implementations, custom CSS may be necessary.

## Enable flex behaviors

Apply `display` utilities to create a flexbox container and transform direct children elements into flex items.
Flex containers and items are able to be modified further with additional flex properties.

## Direction

Set the direction of flex items in a flex container with direction utilities.
In most cases you can omit the horizontal class here as the browser default is `row`.

Use `.flex-row` to set a horizontal direction (the browser default),
or `.flex-row-reverse` to start the horizontal direction from the opposite side.


<Canvas of={FlexStories.DirectionRow} />

Use `.flex-column` to set a vertical direction, or `.flex-column-reverse` to start the vertical direction from the opposite side.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.DirectionColumn} />

## Justify content

Use `justify-content` utilities on flexbox containers to change the alignment of flex items on the main axis (the x-axis to start, y-axis if `flex-direction: column`).
Choose from `flex-start` (browser default), `flex-end`, `center`, `between`, `around`, or `evenly`.

## Align items

Use `align-items` utilities on flexbox containers to change the alignment of flex items on the cross axis (the y-axis to start, x-axis if `flex-direction: column`).
Choose from `stretch` (browser default), `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, or `baseline`.

## Align self

Use `align-self` utilities on flexbox items to change the alignment of a single flex item on the cross axis (the y-axis to start, x-axis if `flex-direction: column`).
Choose from `auto` (browser default), `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`, or `stretch`.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.AlignSelf} />

## Align content

Use `align-content` utilities on flexbox containers to align flex items together on the cross axis.
Choose from `flex-start` (browser default), `flex-end`, `center`, `between`, `around`, or `stretch`. To demonstrate these utilities,
we've enforced `flex-wrap: wrap` and increased the number of flex items.

## Wrap

Use `flex-wrap` utilities on flexbox containers to change the wrapping behavior of flex items.
Choose from `nowrap` (browser default), `wrap`, or `wrap-reverse`.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.Wrap} />

## Fill

Use `flex-fill` utilities to make a flex item fill the available space in a flex container.
This is a shorthand for `flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1;` and `width: 100%`.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.Fill} />

## Grow and Shrink

Use `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` utilities to control the ability of flex items to grow or shrink to fill the space in a flex container.
Use `flex-grow` to control the ability of a flex item to grow to fill the space in a flex container.
Choose from `0` (browser default) or `1`.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.Grow} />

Use `flex-shrink` to control the ability of a flex item to shrink to fit the space in a flex container.
Choose from `0` (browser default) or `1`.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.Shrink} />

## Order

Use `order` utilities to change the visual order of flex items.
Choose from `0` (browser default), `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` or `5`.

<Canvas of={FlexStories.Order} />

## Gap

Use `gap` utilities to set the gap between flex items.
Read more about the `gap` property in the spacing documentation.
