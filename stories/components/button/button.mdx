# Button

Use Educata's custom button styles for actions in forms, dialogs, and more with support for multiple sizes, states, and more.

## Base class

Educata has a base `.btn` class that sets up basic styles such as padding and content alignment.
By default, `.btn` controls have a transparent border and background color, and lack any explicit focus and hover styles.

The `.btn` class is intended to be used in conjunction with our button variants, or to serve as a basis for your own custom styles.

## Variants

Educata includes several button variants, each serving its own semantic purpose, with a few extras thrown in for more control.

## Disable text wrapping

By default, button text will wrap to fit the button width. To disable this behavior, add the `.text-nowrap` class to the button.

## Outline buttons

Outline buttons are a great way to create a button that is less visually prominent than the default button. They are often used for secondary actions or to indicate that an action is not required.
Outline buttons are created by adding the `.btn-outline-*` class to the base class. The outline button will have a transparent background and a border color that matches the button variant.

## Sizes

Add `.btn-lg` or `.btn-sm` for additional sizes.

## Disabled state

Disabled buttons are created by adding the `disabled` attribute to the button element.
