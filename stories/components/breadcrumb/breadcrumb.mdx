# Breadcrumb

Indicate the current page's location within a navigational hierarchy that automatically adds separators via CSS.

## Example

Use an ordered or unordered list with linked list items to create a minimally styled breadcrumb. Use our utilities to add additional styles as desired.

<Canvas of={ChipStories.Example} className='bg-main' />

## Dividers

Use the `dividers` prop to add dividers between the breadcrumb items.
The default divider is a forward slash (`/`), but you can customize it by passing a different character to variable.

<Canvas of={ChipStories.Dividers} className='bg-main' />

> Keep in mind `--ec-breadcrumb-divider` is a CSS variable, so you can use any character you want.
