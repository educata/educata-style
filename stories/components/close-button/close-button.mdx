# Close button

A generic close button for dismissing content like modals and alerts.

## Example

Provide an option to dismiss or close a component with `.btn-close`.

<Canvas of={CloseButton.Example} className='bg-main' />

> Be sure to include text for screen readers, as we've done with `aria-label`.

## Disabled state

Disabled close buttons change their opacity.

<Canvas of={CloseButton.Disabled} className='bg-main' />

## Dark variant

The dark variant of the close button is used in dark mode.

<Canvas of={CloseButton.Black}/>

## Sizes

The close button can be used in different sizes. We have a small and large variant.
